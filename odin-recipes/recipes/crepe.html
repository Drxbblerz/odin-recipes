        <li> 1/4 cup powdered sugar </li>
        <li> 2.5 tablespoons cocoa powder </li>
        <li> 1 Tbsp cinnamon </li>

      </ul>

  <h2> Crepe Batter </h2>
    <h3> Instructions: </h3>
      <ol> 
        <li> In a bowl, mix flour and sugar; in a separate bowl, add two eggs and one yolk, slowly add the vegetable oil while whisking. Then add the whole milk. </li>
        <li> Whisk in the egg mixture with the flour until clump-free and homogenous. </li>
        <li> Strain through a mesh or a chinois. </li>
        <li> In a 10-inch nonstick pan over medium heat, spray some cooking oil; once the pan is hot, add â…“ cup or 78 ml of the batter, immediately swirl and rotate the pan around to coat the entire surface and form it into an even large circle.  </li>
        <li> Let it cook until the top is dry and the underside is just barely starting to get golden brown; flip and cook for 15 seconds, place on a sheet tray and repeat this process with the rest of the batter.  </li>
      </ol>

  <h2> Mexican Hot Chocolate Mix: </h2>
    <ol> 
      <li> Add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, espresso, cayenne and mix in a medium-sized bowl. </li>
    </ol>

  <h2> Creme Anglaise :</h2>
    <h3> (Optional) </h3>
      <ol> 
        <li> Separate the egg yolks and place them in a bowl along with the sugar and whisk them together. </li>
        <li> In a small saucepan, add the cream, milk, and vanilla beans, heat it until lukewarm, pour in a splash of the hot liquid into the egg yolks mixing in little by little until the egg mixture is hot. Pour it back into the milk, and let it heat over medium-low, steering often until it thickens enough to hold a line at the bottom of the pan. </li>
        <li> Strain into a bowl set it over an ice bath, and let it cool down completely. Then, pour creme Anglaise in a squirt bottle (optional). </li>
      </ol>

  <h2> Assembly: </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Spread about one tablespoon of chocolate hazelnut butter in the center of the crepe, folding it in half like a taco, then folding that in half one more time to form a triangle. </li>
      <li> Repeat with the rest, then arrange that on a plate and drizzle with melted chocolate. </li>
      <li> Drizzle over the crepes some of the creme Anglaise. Top them with crushed hazelnuts and a dollop of whipped cream, finishing with a dusting of the Mexican hot chocolate spice.  </li>
    </ol>
